# 10079 TankBot Drivetrain

Based on the "Getting Started" base WPILib project, using REVLib to control the REV SparkMAXs on the robot.

NOTES:
    - YOU WILL NEED REVLIB TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY TO THE ROBOT OR TO EDIT THE CODE!
    For help, go to https://docs.revrobotics.com/revlib/install.'

    - There are four SparkMAXes on the robot; two pairs at the front and back. (the front is where the on/off/enabled bulb is)

    - Either the front pair or the back pair can be used:

    - SparkMAX ID 1 and ID 3 are the front pair (1 as left drive, 3 as right drive).
    - SparkMAX ID 2 and ID 4 are the back pair (2 as left drive, 4 as right drive).
